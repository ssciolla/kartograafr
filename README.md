### About
**_kartograafr_** ‚Äî "kart-uh-GRAFF-fur", or in IPA: ['k…ër.toÀê.*…£raÀêf.f…ôr]

The name is based on the Dutch word for cartographer, "cartograaf", and was changed a little to make it unique. It is 
never capitalized. Since kartograafr is written in Python, a programming language created by a Dutch computer 
programmer (Guido van Rossum), a Dutch-based name is only fitting.

### Purpose
The kartograafr application ...

* searches for Canvas courses and their assignments that are associated with a specific Canvas outcome object
* creates and/or updates ArcGIS groups so that they contain the users of the Canvas course assignments found
* reads part of its configuration (course IDs to be checked) from a page in a specific Canvas course used only for this 
  purpose
* allows support staff to easily update via Canvas the courses to be synchronized with ArcGIS

### Use
kartograafr is maintained by ITS Teaching & Learning at the University of Michigan. The unit runs the service to 
support courses at the university that rely on ArcGIS for assignments. Teaching & Learning currently runs the 
application as a scheduled job using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) containerization technology, the 
[OpenShift Container Platform](https://docs.openshift.com/), and an instance of the 
[Jenkins automation server](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

## <a name='configurationAndSetup'></a>Configuration & Setup

### For Instructors

The kartograafr service was designed so that it can be set up easily for a course by instructors and other support
staff. To designate a course and assignments in Canvas you would like synchronized with ArcGIS, do the following:

1. Email `4-HELP@umich.edu` to request that your course be added to the list of courses on the "kartograafr: 
   Canvas/ArcGIS Integration" configuration page. This will only need to be requested once for each of your courses. 
   You may proceed to the next step while you wait for this request to be fulfilled.
1. Add the "ArcGIS Group" outcome to your course. This will only need to be done once for each of your courses.
    1. On your course's home page, click the "Outcomes" navigation item.
    1. On your course's Outcome page, click the "üîç Find" button. (Note: **_DO NOT_** click the "+ Outcome" button.)
    1. In the dialog box that appears, select the following list items, in order:
        1. "Account Standards"
        1. "University of Michigan - Ann Arbor"
        1. "ArcGIS"
        1. "ArcGIS Group". (Note: Only click the "ArcGIS Group" item in the list immediately to the right of the 
           "ArcGIS" item. **_DO NOT_** click on the larger "ArcGIS Group" link that appears in the wider space in the 
           rightmost part of the dialog box.)
    1. At the bottom right corner of the dialog box, click the "Import" button.
    1. In the alert box with the message "Import outcome 'ArcGIS Group' to group '_your course name here_'?", click the
       "OK" button.
    1. After the import is complete, you will see "ArcGIS Group" in your course's list of outcomes.
1. Each of your course's assignments which are to be synchronized with ArcGIS Online needs to include the "ArcGIS 
   Group" outcome in its rubric. **_You will need to do this for each new assignment you add to the course._** This can 
   be simplified somewhat by adding the "ArcGIS Group" outcome to a single rubric that will be used by multiple 
   assignments. Each assignment that uses that rubric will automatically include the "ArcGIS Group" outcome. It's 
   recommended that rubrics should be given meaningful names. For example, a good name could be "_your course name 
   here_ Rubric (with ArcGIS sync)".
    1. Click on the name of an assignment in the list of your course's assignments.
    1. Edit the assignment's rubric (or add a new rubric if one doesn't already exist).
    1. Click on "üîç Find Outcome".
    1. In the dialog box of your course's outcomes that appears, click "ArcGIS Group" in the list on the left side of 
       the box. (Note: **_DO NOT_** click on the larger "ArcGIS Group" link that appears in the wider space to the 
       right of the list.)
    1. At the bottom right corner of the dialog box, click the "Import" button.
    1. In the alert box with the message "Import outcome 'ArcGIS Group' to group '_your course name here_'?", click the
       "OK" button.
    1. After the import is complete, you will see "ArcGIS Group" as part of the assignment's rubric.
    1. Finally, click the "Update Rubric" button (or the "Create Rubric" button if you were adding a new rubric).
1. Control the synchronization of your assignment with ArcGIS online by setting the "Available From", "Until", and 
   "Due Date" times.
   
Once all of the above requirements are satisfied, kartograafr will synchronize your course's assignments with ArcGIS
Online. It will happen automatically, several times each day.

### For Administrators & Developers

To set up the application, users will need to perform configuration steps in the Canvas and ArcGIS instances that they
want to connect, and specify environment variables to access those instances and determine other application
settings. The following sections provide instructions for how to complete this configuration. (Note: UM-affiliated 
users should contact Teaching & Learning, as much of this configuration is already in place.)

#### Canvas

Within your instance of Canvas, do the following:

1. Create and record an API access token.
1. Record the base URL of the Canvas API.
1. Create an outcome for ArcGIS, and record its ID number.
1. Create a kartograafr configuration course and record its ID number.
    1. Within the new configuration course, create a page named `course-ids`.
    1. Add to the page the URLs of courses to be processed (they will appear as links on the page).
    1. Give support staff the permissions necessary to update that page (add them with the "Teacher" role).

#### ArcGIS

Within your instance of ArcGIS, do the following:

1. Record the organization name in use (e.g., at UM, `devumich` or `umich`).
1. Create a user with permission to create and modify user groups, and record the username and password.

#### Application

For the application to run, environment variables need to be made available through a JSON file named **env.json** 
(or similar). This file provides key-value pairs that help the application access necessary accounts, find Canvas 
entities, and send emails. The application imports this file and uses its values to round out a few configuration 
classes defined in `config.py` (see the **Installation & Development** section below for how to embed this file in the 
application). 

The `env.json` file contains sensitive information, including account login information and an API secret, and thus 
needs to be kept out of source control. Teaching & Learning maintains production, test, and local development versions 
of this file outside of GitHub. A template JSON file called `env_blank.json` has been provided as a starting point.

To create your version of this file, do the following:

1. Copy `env_blank.json`.
1. Rename the file `env.json` (for use in local development) or `[some name].json` (for use in OpenShift).
1. Replace the empty strings and `0`'s with the desired settings and values.

The meanings of the keys and their expected values are described in the table below.

**Key** | **Description**
----- | -----
`Logging_Level` | The minimum level for log messages that will appear in output. `INFO` or `DEBUG` is recommended for most use cases; see [Python's logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).
`Logging_Directory` | The path where log files will be written (see **OpenShift** under Installation & Development for a description of an OpenShift-related restriction on this value).
`SMTP_Server` | The name of the server emails should be sent from, if the `--email` flag is in use.
`Email_Sender_Address` | The name and email address to use in the FROM header of emails sent. This should take the form of "\\"Severus Snape\\" <halfbloodprince@umich.edu>" (make sure to escape double quotes).
`Canvas_Base_URL` | The URL of the Canvas instance you want to pull Canvas data from; for production at UM, this is `umich.instructure.com`.
`Canvas_API_Token` | The API token to use when making requests for data related to courses, assignments, and users.
`Canvas_Config_Course_ID` | The ID number of the configuration course, (see the **Canvas** Configuration section above).
`ArcGIS_Org_Name` | The name of the ArcGIS organization in use.
`ArcGIS_Username` | The name of an arcGIS user with permission for creating and modifying user groups.
`ArcGIS_Passowrd` | The name of the password for the username provided above.

## <a name='DevelopmentAndDeployment'></a>Development & Deployment

The sections below provide instructions for installing and running the application in various environments. Before
attempting to install or deploy, ensure the steps in the **For Administrators & Developers** section in 
Configuration have been completed. Depending on the environment you plan to run the application in, you may also need 
to install some or all of the following:
   * Python 3.7
   * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   * [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)

### Local Development

To set up the application for use locally or in preparation for development work, you can use Docker or `virtualenv`.
For either option, first you'll need to do the following:
 
1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
    ```
    https://github.com/tl-its-umich-edu/kartograafr.git  # HTTPS
    git@github.com:tl-its-umich-edu/kartograafr.git  # SSH
    
    cd kartograafr
    ```
2. Place the `env.json` file previously created in the `configuration/secrets/` directory.

#### With Docker

You can run the application without installing the dependencies manually by leveraging the `Dockerfile` and Docker 
Desktop. To run with Docker, do the following:

1. Build an image.
   ```
   docker build -t kartograafr .
   ```
1. Run a container using the tagged image.
   ```
   docker run kartograafr
   ```

#### With a Virtual Environment

You can also set up the application using `virtualenv` by doing the following:

1. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # for Mac OS
   ```
1. Install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. Install the `arcgis` package separately.
   ```
   pip install arcgis --no-deps
   ```
1. Run the application.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### OpenShift Deployment

Deploying the application as a job using OpenShift and Jenkins involves several steps, which are beyond the scope of
this README. However, it seems appropriate to explain some configuration assumed by the `Dockerfile` and unique to this
application.

* The `env.json` file described in the **Application** section under Configuration needs to be made available to 
  running kartograafr containers via an OpenShift ConfigMap, a type of Resource. A volume containing the ConfigMap 
  should be mapped to the `configuration/secrets` subdirectory. These details will be specified in a configuration file
  (.yaml) defining the pod.

* The kartograafr application writes log files as part of its normal operations. Because of permission restrictions 
  within OpenShift pods, users may need to specify a path for `Logging_Directory` in `env.json` that begins with
  `tmp`. The UM configuration uses `tmp/log/kartograafr`. Note that these log files will disappear with the running
  container.

* By default, the application will run with the assumption that the JSON configuration file will be named `env.json`. 
  However, `config.py` will also check for the environment variable `ENV_FILE`. This variable can be set using the 
  OpenShift pod configuration file. To use a different name for the JSON file, set `ENV_FILE` to a path beginning with 
  `configuration/secrets/` and ending with the file name. With this set, the `env` block in the `.yaml` will look 
  something like this:
  ```
  - env:
      - name: ENV_FILE
        value: /configuration/secrets/env_test.json
  ```

### Sending Email

The application includes optional functionality for sending emails to the instructors of the courses for which it 
maintains ArcGIS groups. To send emails with kartograafr, the `main.py` file needs to be executed using the `--email` 
flag. The following sections explain how to test this during development and to configure the application to send 
emails from an OpenShift pod.

#### Local Development

To assist in testing email functionality, a Shell script called `runDebugEmail.sh` has been provided that creates a 
mock email server. For the time being, there is no established way of using this script while also running locally
with Docker. However, you can test the email capability when using a virtual environment by doing the following:

1. Ensure the `SMTP_Server` value in `env.json` is set to `localhost:1025`.
1. Execute the Shell script to start the server.
   ```
   /bin/bash runDebugEmail.sh
   ```
1. In a separate terminal window, run `main.py`.
   ```
   python main.py --email
   ```
The email will appear in the window where you ran the Shell script.

Alternatively, you can print the email content as part of the application's output (without using the mock server) by 
passing the `--printEmail` flag when executing `main.py`.
```
python main.py --email --printEmail
```

#### In OpenShift

When deploying with OpenShift, the application can be configured to send email by defining the `SEND_EMAIL` 
environment variable in the pod configuration file -- just as in the process described in the **OpenShift Deployment** 
section above for setting `ENV_FILE`. To have the application send email, ensure the correct `SMTP_Server` value for
the OpenShift environment is set in `env.json`, and then set `SEND_EMAIL` to the string `"True"` in the pod's `.yaml`.
(If the value for `SEND_EMAIL` is not set or set to any other string, the application will not send email.) With this 
variable set, the `env` block of the pod configuration file will look something like this:

```
- env:
    - name: SEND_EMAIL
      value: "True"
```
